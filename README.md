# Bakeru (化ける) - Shapeshifter Solver

**Bakeru (化ける)**, meaning "to transform" in Japanese, is a modern **Tauri Application** designed to help solve the Neopets game **Shapeshifter**. It features a Rust backend supplied with a low-level, pointer-optimized backtracking algorithm, paired with a clean React-based user interface.

Originally, when I built this tool, it was built as a Windows-only Visual Studio C# application. While functional, the interface was clunky and difficult to maintain. And the application was not cross-platform. This complete rewrite into the Tauri ecosystem provides that support, a more responsive UI, and similar solving speeds.

Official releases for Windows, Linux, and macOS can be found under the **[Releases](https://github.com/willnjohnson/Bakeru/releases)** section.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please add this **[GreaseMonkey script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/566826-bakeru-web-visualizer-for-shapeshifter)** to your GreaseMonkey/TamperMonkey extension for browser convenience, which will:
> * Help quickly extract puzzle data with a "Copy HTML" button.
> * Provide visual symbol replacement to match the solver's clean interface.

## App Preview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TODO:** Add preview of the app.

## Features

*   **Fast HTML Parsing:** Instantly extracts the grid state and token shapes from the Neopets source code.
*   **Native Performance:** Core solver implemented in Rust using raw pointers and aggressive optimization profiles, with similar performance to the original C implementation.
*   **Asynchronous Solving:** The solver runs on a separate thread, keeping the UI fluid and responsive even during multi-minute searches for high-level puzzles.
*   **Progressive UI:** Visual board preview that updates with your progress through the solution steps.
*   **Symmetry Pruning:** Detects equivalent tokens to avoid redundant search permutations, critical for levels 40+.

## Puzzle Data

*   **Grid Layout:** The $M \times N$ board containing various token types.
*   **Token Sequence:** The specific set of puzzle shapes provided by the game for the current level.
*   **Goal:** The specific token type (usually swords) that all cells must match to win.

## Requirements

*   **Windows**: `.exe` or `.msi` installers.
*   **Linux**: `.AppImage`, `.deb`, or `.rpm` packages.
*   **macOS**: `.dmg` or `.app` bundles.
*   *Note: Binaries are available in the GitHub Releases section.*

## Usage

1.  **Launch the Bakeru application.**
2.  **Paste the HTML source** of your current Shapeshifter puzzle into the input area.
3.  **Click "Solve"** to begin the process.
4.  Follow the **Solution Steps** provided. You can check them off as you go.
5.  Hover over or click a step to see the placement highlighted on the board preview.

> [!TIP]
> If a puzzle seems impossible or the search is taking too long, lose the game on purpose to generate a new grid and try again!

## Output

Results are displayed in the "Solution Steps" sidebar. Each step is zero-padded (e.g., `Step 01:`) and provides coordinates in `Row Y, Col X` format. The main board view allows you to visualize the current state of the puzzle as you apply each step.

## Algorithms

Throughout its development, this project has explored several search strategies to conquer the Shapeshifter puzzle:

1.  **Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS):** The fundamental approach, exploring every possible placement sequence.
2.  **A-Star & IDA-Star (Iterative Deepening A-Star):** Guided search using the number of non-goal cells as a heuristic. While robust, these often suffered from high memory usage or redundant re-explorations.
3.  **The Chosen Approach: Optimized Backtracking with Symmetry Pruning:** 
    *   **Low-Level Rust Implementation:** Uses raw pointers to achieve performance parity with original C solvers.
    *   **In-Place State Toggling:** Modifies the grid state directly and reverses changes during backtracking to avoid expensive allocations.
    *   **Pruning:** Aggressively prunes branches using a "toggle budget" and by identifying equivalent token shapes to skip redundant permutations.

## Benchmarks

I managed to port Kvho's code (532 lines, not counting comments or whitespace) to Rust in 199 lines (not counting comments or whitespace). Below is the comparison of performance for different levels:
